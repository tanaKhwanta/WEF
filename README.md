## Introduction 88

This tool is designed for security researchers and penetration testers to analyze and exploit vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks. It provides an intuitive interface with a wide range of automated and manual attack techniques to test WPA/WPA2, WPS, and WEP security. With support for both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks, detailed logging and customizable attack options, it offers flexibility for different testing scenarios. This is not a professional tool.

If you find an error, please open an issue (you can write it in english or spanish, as you want).

## TODO

- Custom Evil Twin templates based on target AP vendor (TP-Link, Netgear, etc)
- Even more languages for Evil Twin templates
- More WPA3 attacks: Downgrade, Dragondrain
- ~~Sort APs by default by power to show which APs are closer~~
- ~~WEF now works as a standalone script~~
- ~~Disassociation is now supported alongside deauthentication~~
- ~~Vendors are no longer parsed from a local file~~
- ~~APs scanning has been improved, now APs with clients are marked in green colour~~
- ~~Evil Twin now supports PMKID handshake to check captured passwords~~
- ~~MAC randomization/spoofing improved~~
- ~~Filters for WPS and WPA3 when scanning APs~~
- ~~Most attacks were reworked and/or improved, new options are available~~
- ~~Graphical session and windows were reworked~~
- ~~Non-Graphical usage has been improved~~
- ~~Automatic dependencies installation on main distros~~
- ~~Deep testing on supported distros (Manjaro, Fedora, Parrot, Debian, etc)~~
- ~~Requirements were updated. Some more were added although the should be installed on most distros~~
- ~~WPA3 attack optimized~~
- ~~Now certificate files needed for Enterprise Evil Twin are generated automatically~~
- ~~More languages supported on Evil Twin templates (czech, danish and romanian)~~
- ~~Now wordlists are not needed anymore as dependencies~~
- ~~Better error handling for most scenarios~~
- ~~Multiple bug fixes~~
